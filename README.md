# Wildfire and Infrastructure Risk Dashboard

An interactive visualization of historic wildfire, landslide, and road condition data for the state of Oregon built with Pandas and Folium.

## Description

Upon loading the website, you will be greeted with a map filled with hexagons, representing the density of events in that area. These event hexes are clickable, allowing users to view a breakdown of the amount of fires and landslides in the given area.

The web interface features multiple layers to view different aspects of the data, including major highways and specific unstable slope data along these highways.
